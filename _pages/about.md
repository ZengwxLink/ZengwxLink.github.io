Hi! I am Kefan Tang, a third-year Ph.D. student at the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, supervised by [Prof. Xinbo Gao](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/xbgao/). Prior to that, I received a B.E. degree in Automation from Dalian Maritime University in 2020. I am currently a visiting student at [NExT++ Lab](https://www.nextcenter.org/) at the National University of Singapore, advised by [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/chuats/). My research interests include Multimodal Information Retrieval, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.
